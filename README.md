Snowball

Your goal is to kill the flames by throwing snowballs at them before they reach the snowman.

To throw a snowball, grab one from the back of your head and press the Trigger button on your controller.
You can also grab snowballs from one of the four Snowpiles on the platform.

If you want to have a bigger snowball you can Merge two by holding two snowballs and putting them together and releasing one of them, there is four different sizes.

The flames will spawn from the Campfires at the trees as soon as you throw a Snowball on the Snowman in the middle.
When all enemies are dead you will see a text above the snowman, throw a snowball at it to start a new wave.
